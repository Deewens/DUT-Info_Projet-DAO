Java Computer Aided Design (CAD) application for drawing simple and complex geometrical shapes.
It was my first real program with a graphical interface in Java. I learned important Object-Oriented Programming concepts, and the practical application of geometrical and mathematical concepts.

## Features

Current features:

* Draw geometric object
    * Triangle
    * Line
    * Quadrangle
    * Rhombus
    * Circle
    * Ellipse
    * Rectangle
    * Arc of a circle
    * Polyline (multi-line)
    * Multi-rectangle
    * Multi-circle
    * Multi-ellipse
* Free drawing
* Change of line thickness
* Change of colour
* Partial and total deletion
* Save draw to an image file
* Move objects

This project was quite substantial and I am quite satisfied with the work that my partner and I accomplished, the software being complete and stable.

## Known issues

* Some shapes have problems when you try to create them from the bottom up.
    - **Workaround:** Create your shapes from top to bottom
* The saving system take a screenshot of the board, and the screenshot is not always nice 
* Somes little other issues...
